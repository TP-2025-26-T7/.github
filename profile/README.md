# 🚦 Virtual Intersection

**Coordinated system for autonomous vehicles in motion**  
Team project at FIIT STU.

---

## ℹ️ About the project

The goal of the project is to design and implement an intelligent system that enables RC cars/virtual cars to navigate intersections:
- communicate with the system,
- coordinate their manoeuvres in real time,
- pass through intersections safely and efficiently.

Our focus is on connecting and advancing previous Team projects with the addition of bringing the project to real RC cars.
